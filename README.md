# Super DMG-01

A [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/) 6.0 recreation of the original Game Boy, with a few modern twists.

One of the main goals of this project is to build an entire DMG using only a DMG CPU or a SGB CPU.

## Credits

- bit9 for the [DMG schematics](https://imgur.com/a/X5qKI) and [board scans](https://chipmusic.org/forums/post/215957/#p215957)
- [Gekkio](https://github.com/Gekkio) for the CPU, RAM, CART symbols from [Gekkio KiCad libs](https://github.com/Gekkio/gekkio-kicad-libs)
- [Wesk](https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?members/wesk.1486/) for [these amazing DMG shell scans](https://bitbuilt.net/forums/index.php?threads/dmg-gameboy-scan.4479/), which allow me to do all sort of adapters and covers and whatnot, and test the pcb fitment virtually

## Boards

Like an original DMG, the Super DMG-01 is made out of separate boards. Doumentation for each board can be found in the relative sub-folders:

- CPU Board: [Super DMG CPU](super-dmg-cpu)
- JACK Board: [Super DMG JACK](super-dmg-jack)

## 3rd party boards

To complete the game boy additional boards are required:

- DC CONV Board: use [MouseBiteLabs](https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs)' [DMGC-PWR-01](https://github.com/MouseBiteLabs/Game-Boy-DMG-Color/tree/main/DMGC-PWR-01) or use one from a DMG
- LCD Board: Use any of the available IPS kits or use one from a DMG

## Disclaimer

I am not an electronics expert. Super DMG-01 might fry your games, set your house on fire and kill your pets.
